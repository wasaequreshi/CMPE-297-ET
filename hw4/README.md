# HW 4 Explanation

### Source

I used the following repos to complete this assignment:

- [Tabular](https://github.com/AutoViML/deep_autoviml/blob/master/examples/Deep_Auto_ViML_Titanic.ipynb)
- [Image](https://github.com/AutoViML/deep_autoviml/blob/master/examples/Deep_Auto_ViML_Image_Classification_Demo.ipynb)
- [NLP](https://github.com/AutoViML/deep_autoviml/blob/master/examples/Deep_Auto_ViML_NLP_Demo.ipynb)


### Explanation
This really showed how automatic the AutoViML framework is. It required very minimal effort and work and could create a relatively effective model within minutes. The setup for the 3 ipynb files is similar to the source. However some of the code is outdated or missing which allowed me to get a little depth into what was going on and how to fix it. 

Also please see the `Model` section of the ipynb file statistics! 

### Demo
Please see the ipynb files and their outputs.
