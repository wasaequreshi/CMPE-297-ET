# HW 7 (First) Explanation

### Source

I used the following repos to complete this assignment:

- [Snorkel](https://colab.research.google.com/github/practical-nlp/practical-nlp/blob/master/Ch2/06_Snorkel.ipynb?authuser=1)
- [Active Learning](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/rachhouse/intro-to-data-linking/blob/main/tutorial_notebooks/03_Link_FEBRL_Data_with_Active_Learning.ipynb)

Most of the implementation was copy and paste but I had to move things around to make it work. This in addition gave me exposure to understand the code as I tried to copy and paste to make it work. 

### Part a (Snorkel) and Part b (Active Learning)

Both of these activities were very interactive. The Snorkel one gave good hands on how you can create so many different types of labeling function and apply them. The Active Learning one was very one, the process of actually interjecting and providing feedback with a 'yes', 'no', or 'unsure' was very cool.

### Demo

Please take a look at the ipynb files. They have results and visualizations.
